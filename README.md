## A* search algorithm üîç
This repo contain material about the A* search algorithm.

The folder [A* Viz](https://github.com/laisbsc/a_star/tree/master/a_star_viz) contains a Path Search Algorithm game built using PyGame and Python 3.5.6.
The [Notebook](https://github.com/laisbsc/a_star/blob/master/a_star_alg_Lais_Carvalho.ipynb) contains the coursework submission and the explanation on detail of the implementation ofr the A* search algorithim.

### Next steps:
- [ ] ~~add one README.md file for the GUI with instructions on installing dependencies and the virtual environment.~~
- [ ] introduce the Notebooks files and explain the idea behind them on a this README.
